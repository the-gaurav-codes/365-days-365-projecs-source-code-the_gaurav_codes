# 🚀 3D Distance Calculator

Welcome to the **3D Distance Calculator**! This project is part of my **#365Challenge** where I build and share a project every day. This tool calculates the distance between two points in a **3D space** using a simple formula.

## 🔥 Live Preview

🔗 **[Live Demo on Netlify](https://3d-distance-calculator-gaurav.netlify.app/)**


## 📌 What is this project about?
This **3D Distance Calculator** takes three coordinates (X, Y, and Z) for two points and calculates the straight-line distance between them. This is useful in **graphics programming, physics simulations, game development,** and more.

## 📐 How does it work?
We use the **Euclidean distance formula**:

```
d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)
```

### ✨ Features
✅ User-friendly input fields for X, Y, and Z coordinates
✅ Instant calculation on button click
✅ Simple and clean UI
✅ Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** - To structure the webpage
- **CSS** - To style and make the page visually appealing
- **JavaScript** - To handle calculations dynamically

## 📖 Code Explanation (Line by Line)

### **1. HTML (index.html)**
- **Creates input fields** for users to enter X, Y, and Z coordinates.
- **A button** to trigger the distance calculation.
- **A display area** to show the result.

### **2. CSS (style.css)**
- **Styles the input fields, button, and result box.**
- **Makes the layout responsive** so it looks good on all devices.

### **3. JavaScript (script.js)**
- Captures user inputs when the button is clicked.
- Applies the **3D distance formula**.
- Displays the calculated result instantly on the page.

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project Locally
