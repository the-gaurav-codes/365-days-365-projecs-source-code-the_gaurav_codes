# 🗓️  Age Calculator

## 🚀 About the Project
The **Age Calculator** is a comprehensive and interactive web-based tool that allows users to determine their exact age based on their date of birth. Unlike a simple age calculation, this tool provides an in-depth breakdown of age in terms of years, months, weeks, and days. It also includes additional utilities such as a leap year checker, countdown to the next birthday, and real-time updates.

Whether you are simply curious about your precise age or need detailed age analytics for any purpose, this project serves as an engaging and valuable tool.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Leap Year Checker**: Determines if the user's birth year was a leap year and how many leap years they have experienced.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI**: User-friendly, attractive interface that enhances usability and engagement.
- 📊 **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows different formats of age, such as:

- 🌐 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- 🆓 **Open Source & Collaborative**: Contributions are welcome! Join the development and help improve the tool.
